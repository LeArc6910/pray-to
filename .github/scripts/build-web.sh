# Runs inside GameCI's Unity image (unityci/editor) for the Web demo workflow: activates a Unity Personal license
# with the account's email and password, builds the web demo into the folder given as $1, and returns the license
# however the build ends.
#
# GameCI's own activation (unity-builder) always passes a serial, taking it from a ULF file for Personal licenses.
# Unity 6 Personal licenses have no serial and Hub leaves no ULF, so that fails with "serial invalid". The Licensing
# Client that ships with the editor can activate Personal directly: --activate-ulf without --serial.
#
# Needs UNITY_EMAIL and UNITY_PASSWORD in the environment. UNITY_LICENSING_CLIENT and UNITY_EDITOR override the
# image's paths (for testing outside the image).
